# 🎓 CampusHub - AI-Powered Campus Event Management Platform

CampusHub is a modern **full-stack MERN application** that streamlines campus event management by connecting **students** and **coordinators** on a single platform. It enables coordinators to publish and manage events while allowing students to discover, register, and stay updated about workshops, hackathons, placement drives, and campus activities.

What makes CampusHub unique is its **AI-powered Campus Assistant**, which answers student queries using real-time event data stored in the application's database instead of acting as a generic chatbot.
